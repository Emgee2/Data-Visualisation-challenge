In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumours received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The visualization were created as below:

Final analysis

	Based on the box plots of the tumour volume for each treatment group, the effectiveness of Capomulin seems comparable to Ramicane; it is significantly more effective than Infubinol and Ceftamine.

	There is only one outlier in the data set for the top drugs; thus, the study’s results are very reliable.

	There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumour volume; it is 0.84. Therefore the heavier the mouse is, the less drug effective.
